      <p>
        The OSPool is a source of
        computing capacity that is accessible to any researcher affiliated with a
        US academic institution. Capacity is allocated following a Fair-Share
        policy. To harness the OSPool capacity you will need to obtain an
        account via the <a href="https://portal.osg-htc.org">OSG Portal</a>.

      <p>
        Each of your jobs must fit on a single server. It has to be portable so
        that it can run on a remote server. The distributed nature of the OSPool
        imposes constraints on the sizes of the input and output sandboxes of a
        job.

      <p>
        The computing resources for the OSPool are contributed by members of the
        OSG Compute Federation, typically campuses, government-supported
        supercomputing centers, and research collaborations. The members individually
        determine their policies for contributing resources, including the
        amount of resources it contributes and when these resources are available.
        In addition, some resource providers decide to share their resources with
        specific research projects, or they may choose to contribute resources to
        all in the OSPool.

      <h2 id="what-types-of-work-run-well-on-the-ospool">What types of work run well on the OSPool?</h2>

      <p>For problems that can be run as numerous, self-contained jobs, the OSPool provides computing capacity that can transform the types of questions researchers are able to tackle (see the table below). A wide range of research problems and computational methods can be broken up or otherwise executed in this high-throughput computing (HTC ) approach, including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>image analysis (including MRI, GIS, etc.)</li>
        <li>text-based analysis, including DNA read mapping and other bioinformatics</li>
        <li>parameter sweeps</li>
        <li>model optimization approaches, including Monte Carlo methods</li>
        <li>machine learning and AI executed with multiple independent training tasks, different parameters, and/or data subsets</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The OSPool is made up of mostly opportunistic capacity - contributing clusters may interrupt jobs at any time. Thus, the OSPool supports workloads of numerous jobs that individually complete or checkpoint within 20 hours.</p>

      <p><strong>Importantly, many compute tasks can take advantage of the OSPool with simple modifications, and we’d love to discuss options with you!</strong></p>

      <p>We have a complete <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/home">knowledge base of user documentation</a>
        and an active and supportive <a href="https://support.opensciencegrid.org/support/solutions/articles/12000084585">facilitation team</a>,
        who support all users on OSG-Operated Access Points.</p>

      <p>Users submitting jobs can specify their own requirements for per-job compute resources (e.g. CPU cores, memory, etc.) and any special server requirements. We recommend submitting lots of jobs and taking advantage of all the cycles possible, wherever they may be. We cannot guarantee that any single job will finish quickly, but the OSPool will allow you to accomplish a tremendous amount of work across jobs.</p>
