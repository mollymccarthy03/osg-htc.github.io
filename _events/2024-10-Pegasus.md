<p style="font-size: larger; font-weight: bold;">Sign Up for October OSG User Training!</p>

Sign up for our "Workflows with Pegasus" User Training on Tuesday, October 15! Any researcher at a US institution can join this training.  No account is necessary. 

Hosted by the OSG Facilitation team, this training will cover an introduction to the Pegasus Workflow Management System, which is a useful tool for researchers needing to execute a large number of jobs or complex workflows. Attendees will learn how to construct and manage workflows, capabilities like automatic data transfers, and higher level tooling to analyze the workflow performance. 

Training is a mix of presentation and hands-on. No prior experience is needed, however, a basic understanding of HTCondor job submission and HTCondor submit files will make it easier to understand the content presented. 

Registration opens one month in advance of the training.

All User Training sessions are offered from 2:30-4pm ET on the third Tuesday of the month.
