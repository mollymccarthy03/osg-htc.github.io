The [Open Science Data Federation (OSDF)](https://osg-htc.org/services/osdf.html) 
is an OSG service designed to support the sharing of files staged in 
autonomous “origins”, for efficient access to those files from anywhere 
in the world via a global namespace and network of caches. 

The OSDF is powered by the [Pelican Platform](https://pelicanplatform.org/),
 a tool that makes it easier to deliver data. One of its core components is 
the data origin, a service that makes it possible to access data sets 
through a client. 

In this training, we will provide an introduction to Pelican and the OSDF, and 
then dive into a hands-on example of how 
to launch your own Pelican Origin service for integrating into an existing Pelican Data 
Federation, such as the OSDF.

Training is a mix of presentation and hands-on.
